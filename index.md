# Hello, World!

Welcome to my website! This is a simple site built with Jekyll and Markdown.

I created this site to share my journey as a software engineer, showcase my projects, and write about topics that interest me. Whether it's coding tips, travel experiences, or anything in between, you'll find it all here.

Take a look around, and feel free to reach out if you want to connect!
